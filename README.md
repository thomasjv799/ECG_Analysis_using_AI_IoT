<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This repo contains the code and the best model used for the paper. There are two main folders, IoT contains the code used for IoT part of the project and DL contains about the notebook used for training and the best model we saved.

### Built With

Some of the important softwares and libraries that was used in the research.


* [Biosspy](https://biosppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [WFDB](https://physionet.org/content/wfdb-python/4.1.0/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In order to understand how the model was created refer the notebook in the DL Folder. The IoT part contains some of the code used to collect the ECG Signal. Relevant knowlege of Python and deep learning is required in order to understand the code. Try to create a copy before running as it can tamper with the original resuls.
